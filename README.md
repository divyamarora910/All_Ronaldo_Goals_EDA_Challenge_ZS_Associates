# All_Ronaldo_Goals_EDA_Challenge_ZS_Associates

This repository contains the modelling code and Exploratory Data Analysis done for ZS Data Science Challenge 2019.Link for the challenge is:
https://www.interviewbit.com/contest/zs-yds-2019/

This repository includes two notebooks:
  1. EDA.ipynb - for data preprocessing, data wrangling, data visualization and feature engineering.
  2. Model.ipynb - for predictive modelling.

This hackathon was all about data cleaning and getting the actual data from the given data which was felt like some puzzle since many columns had two variants of same column so they actually needed to be used to create the final actual dataset.

Lot of time was spent to fill the null values based on similar logical columns.(Focused in EDA notebook.)
